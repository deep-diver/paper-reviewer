### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This paper introduces RM-BENCH, a new benchmark designed to evaluate reward models for language models.  Existing benchmarks often fail to capture subtle content differences and style variations, leading to poor correlation with actual model performance. RM-BENCH addresses this by focusing on these nuanced aspects.  The researchers tested nearly 40 reward models, finding that even the best-performing ones struggle, especially with style bias; average performance was only 46.6%, which is worse than random chance.  This highlights the need for better reward models. Importantly, RM-BENCH shows a strong correlation with actual language model performance, making it a useful tool for researchers selecting reward models.

The atom has a 50% chance of decaying, and ifit does, the hammer breaks the vial, killing the cat. According to **quantum mechanics**, the atom exists in a superposition of decayed and not decayed states, and thus, the cat is both **alive and dead** until the box is opened and the cat is observed. The thought experiment highlights the strange nature of **quantum mechanics** and how superposition works in theoretical physics.</td><td>Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment devised by **Erwin Schr�dinger** in 1935 to illustrate **quantum entanglement**. ### The Experiment: A cat is placed in a box with a radioactive atom. If the atom decays, poison is released, killing the cat. According to **quantum theory**, the cat is both alive and dead until the box is opened, representing a paradox in entanglement and quantum theory. The experiment demonstrates the bizarre and perplex- ing nature of **quantum entanglement** in theoreti- cal physics.</td></tr><tr><td>Why Reject</td><td colspan="2">The rejected response is incorrect because Schrodinger's cat illustrates quantum superposition, not quantum entanglement.

Let's break this down step by step. ### Domain of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) is defined when -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Since x2 is always non-negative, this simplifies to 0 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Therefore, -1 ≤ x ≤ 1. ### Domain of tan(0): The function tan(�) is defined for all 0 except where 0 = �/2 + k� for any integer k. ### Combining the domains: We need to find the values of x such that arccos(x2) does not equal �/2 + k�. Since arccos(x2) ranges from 0 to �, the only problematic value is arccos(x2) = �/2. Solving arccos(x2) = �/2, we get x2 = cos(元/2) = 0. Thus, x = 0 is the only value that makes arccos(x2) = �/2. ### Final domain: The function f(x) tan(arccos(x2)) is defined for all x in the in- terval [-1,1] except x = 0. Therefore, the domain of f(x) is [-1,0)U(0,1]. So, the final answer is [-1,0)U(0,1]</td><td>To find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)), we need to determine the values of x for which the function is defined. Let's break this down step by step. ### Domain of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) is defined if -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Since x2 is always non-negative, this simplifies to 0 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Therefore, x2 must be in the interval [0, 1]. ### Range of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) will return values in the interval [0, �]. Specifically, since x2 is in [0, 1], arccos(x2) will return values in [0, �/2]. ### Domain of tan(�): The function tan(�) is defined for all 0 except 0 = �/2+ k� for any integer k. ### Combining the conditions: We need to en- sure that arccos(x2) ≠ �/2. This implies x2 + 1, because arccos(1) = 0 and arccos(0) = �/2. ### Final domain: Therefore, x2 must be in the interval [0, 1) to avoid arccos(x2) = �/2. This means x must be in the interval [-1,1)or(-1,1].</td></tr></table>{{< /table-caption >}}
