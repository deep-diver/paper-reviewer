### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

This research introduces CBT-BENCH, a three-level benchmark to assess Large Language Models' (LLMs) potential in aiding Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Level 1 tests basic CBT knowledge; Level 2 evaluates cognitive model understanding (identifying distortions and core beliefs); and Level 3 assesses therapeutic response generation in simulated therapy sessions.  The study uses multiple-choice questions and newly created datasets (CBT-QA, CBT-CD, CBT-PC, CBT-FC, CBT-DP) to evaluate several LLMs. Results show LLMs excel at Level 1 (knowledge recall), but performance drops significantly in Levels 2 and 3 (complex reasoning and therapeutic responses).  This underscores the limitations of current LLMs in handling the nuanced aspects of CBT and indicates promising areas for future research focusing on improving LLMs' abilities in complex real-world scenarios.

#### Why does it matter?
The paper introduces CBT-BENCH, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to assist Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).  It includes three levels of tasks, from basic knowledge to therapeutic response generation, and reveals that while LLMs excel at recalling CBT knowledge, they struggle with complex reasoning and real-world therapeutic interactions.
#### Key Takeaways

They had a perfectly good house at the time they just wanted their dream house. Thoughts: I am a victim with no power in this situation. I must accept this behavior. I am too scared to leave this situation. I am not worthy of better. His parents hate me. His parents do not want us to get married. He may not want to marry me either. He loves his parents more than me. I will always be second in his life. His parents had no need for a house, and I know this for sure. I am aware of every aspect of this situation.</td><td>all-or-nothing thinking; person- alization; mind reading</td></tr><tr><td>CBT-PC</td><td>Situation: I had an amazing childhood. When I was twelve in 2004, my father had to go to Iraq. My mother thought it would be best if she moved my brother and I back to the U.S., where we would have family support. I was very depressed because my dad was my hero and I blamed my mom for everything that went wrong. I felt like no one understood me... When my dad came back, he wanted a divorce from my mother. Thoughts: Everything was great until my mom messed everything up. Because of her, my brother and I had to leave our dad. We ended up living somewhere where no one liked me. It's her fault that I never felt like I fit in. Even when my dad came back, he didn't want us either - he wanted a divorce. I guess no one will ever want me in their life. I'll probably be alone forever.</td><td>helpless; unlovable</td></tr><tr><td>CBT-FC</td><td>Situation: My daughter was recently diagnosed as bipolar. If I say anything about seeking treatment, my daughter accuses me of not understanding her and what is happening to her. She is very paranoid and worries about her safety all the time. I need to know how to talk to her and what to do to get her into treatment. Thoughts: I am a bad mother. This is my fault. It is so shameful that my daughter has bipolar. If my daughter gets worse, then it will be my fault for not getting her into treatment. I need to do something. This is my responsibility.</td><td>I am incompetent; I am help- less; I am powerless, weak, vul- nerable; I am bad - dangerous, toxic, evil</td></tr></table>{{< /table-caption >}}

We have deep conversations about various topics, share laughs, and seem to have a strong connection. However, every few months, he suddenly becomes distant. The usual daily communication slows down, his tone becomes cold, and there's a noticeable disconnect. After giving it some space and bringing it up gently, he admits to withdrawing and usually provides a reason for his behavior, such as feeling disrespected or abandoned. We address the issues, talk about feelings and needs, and find better ways to communicate. He has a therapist, and I encourage him to work on these issues, but the cycle repeats. Thoughts: I am not enough for him. Why do I always get hurt like this. I always get stuck in these endless cycles, and I am unlovable.</td><td>helpless; unlovable</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I would move out, but I don't have the money for that nor do I have the job.

I must remain in this situation until I have more money. The only way out is to be more financially secure. I cannot let other people know or help me.

When I confront him about it, he says he has a public sex fetish and needs to fulfill it, believing that it helps keep him ,,faithful%o to me since I am no longer interested. Thoughts: He calls that faithful? It doesn't feel faithful. But I don't know ifI even have the right to feel the way I do about it - after all, that's pretty much how our relationship started. Am I even allowed to be upset? I'm the one that changed, so it feels like it's my fault. I shouldn't be blaming him. He tried to get me involved, but when I said I wasn 't into it, he didn't push, he just continued on doing what made him happy. Plus, he's not doing this to hurt me, so I shouldn't feel hurt by it. I should be happy for him that he is feeling fulfilled.

While there, I was physically, emotionally, and sexually abused. I couldn't talk to anyone because I had no trust in adults. Thoughts: I was born defective and wrong, so that's why my parents had such a hard time raising me. I was hard to love because I was so different.

Thoughts: Something is wrong with me. I am losing my mind. Nobody understands me. Everyone would reject me if they knew.</td><td>I am helpless</td><td>The client's thought, "Nobody understands me,' suggests a need for connection and vali- dation, which the model might have missed by emphasizing helplessness.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: When I go to the store, I believe that I hear peo- ple talking about me in their heads, as though I can hear their thoughts. Thoughts: I am capable of hearing other people's thoughts. People are talking to me in their heads. I am telepathic. I am certain of these things. Because I hear voices, they must be coming from other people.</td><td>I am out of control</td><td>The client's thoughts reflect con- viction (e.g., "I am telepathic") rather than fear, indicating a be- lief in special abilities rather than being out of control. The model may not be very clear about the difference between the two.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I have a problem of automatically looking at things like shiny objects or body parts. I don't have any bad intentions but people misunderstand me. Thoughts: This is something to be ashamed of. I always do it. Something is wrong with me. I stop looking at these things. People will reject me because of this habit. This habit is out of my control.</td><td>I am immoral</td><td>The client explicitly states they have no bad intentions, indicat- ing the issue is about loss of con- trol, not morality. The model can't may have neglected this infor- mation.</td></tr></table>{{< /table-caption >}}
