### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current text-to-image models struggle with precise control over visual concepts. This paper introduces "component-controllable personalization," a new task aiming to modify specific parts (components) of a concept during personalization.  This is challenging due to "semantic pollution" (unwanted elements corrupting the concept) and "semantic imbalance" (uneven learning of concept and component). To tackle this, the researchers propose MagicTailor, a framework with two key techniques: Dynamic Masked Degradation (DM-Deg) dynamically perturbs undesired elements, and Dual-Stream Balancing (DS-Bal) balances learning between the concept and component.  Experiments show MagicTailor significantly outperforms existing methods in this challenging task, generating images with both accurate concept representation and precise component control.  It also shows promise in various applications and collaborations with other generative tools.
